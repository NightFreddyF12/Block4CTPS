Use this document to record your answers to the Parson's Problems
shared in class.

Remember: the idea behind a Parson's Problem is that you are
shown completely correct code that is presented OUT OF ORDER.
When arranged correctly, the code does what the Parson's Problem
says it should do.

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #1 below:
#basic for loop
for x in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10:
    print("hello world!")

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #2 below:
#basic list
myList = ["apples", "pineapples"]
myList.append("pears")
myList.reverse()
print(myList)

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #3 below:
#basic conditional
x = input("Type a number    ")
x = int(x)
if x > 0:
    print("That're more than nothing!")
else:
    print("That's a small number!")
