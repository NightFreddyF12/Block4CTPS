List Building Program

-------------------!!NOTICE!!-------------------
The 10th function is still a work in progress, so please avoid using that.

Onto the details.
----------------------------------------------------
I made this program in Python mainly because it's the first coding language I ever learned and is very easy to use.
This program uses the "random" library (allows us to sort the list, pick a random number, and more) and an empty list.

1st Function: Adds a certian number to the list.
2nd Function: Adds as many numbers in whatever range you want.
3rd Function: Allows us to find a number from index position 0 (the actual first position) to wherever it ends.
4th Function: Sorts the list into numerical order.
5th Function: Searches for a random number.
6th Function: Searches for a certain number and returns the first result.
7th Function: Searches for a certain number repeatedly.
8th Function: Searches for a certain number to check if it's in the list.
9th Function: Prints (allows us to see) the list we've created
10th Function (experimental): Limits the list to 10,000 numbers/integers.
11th Function: Quits out of the program.

-------------------How To Use-------------------
Step 1: Open the program.
Step 2: Choose which function you would like to use.
Step 3: Enjoy!
