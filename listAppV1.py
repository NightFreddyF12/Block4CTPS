"""
Program Goals:
1. Get input from the user (at multiple points)
2. We need to convert some of this input to INTs from STRs
3. We need to provide choices to the user
    a. Add more values to a list
    b. Return a value at a specific index

    print("Choose from the following options. Type a number below!")
    choice = input("1. Add to a list , 2. Return the value at an index position")
    if choice == "1":
        addToList()
    elif choice == "2":
        indexValues()
    #TO ADD: 1. A way to loop the action, 2. A way to quit, 3. Think of repitition
